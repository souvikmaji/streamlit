# A note on browser testing strategy. We are only testing on Chromium because:
#   - Firefox seems to be failing but can't reproduce locally and video from CI
#     produces an empty element for PyDeck
#   - Webkit is too slow on CI, leading to flaky tests
#
# Getting coverage in Chromium is sufficient for now since the underlying logic
# is the same and we are not testing for browser-specific behavior.
#
# Additionally, even the deck.gl docs caution against visual tests since it
# renders to a canvas element:
# https://github.com/visgl/deck.gl/blob/master/docs/developer-guide/testing.md
